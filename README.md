## Sara Riley

As a child I loved building with Lego and now it’s blocks of code that I play with to construct my creations. I am an enthusiastic, hard-working full stack junior developer with a love of both design and function. My background is in residential childcare but I when I began craving a new challenge I decided to be bold and reach higher. My dream career checklist looked like this:
 - intellectually and creatively stimulating
 - provides continual opportunity for development
 - flexible and transferable
 - in-demand and growing field

I realised a career in tech ticks all the boxes so I set about teaching myself to code. Makers Academy was the obvious choice for accelerating my learning and progressing me further toward my goal. I'm now keen to work in a dynamic organisation with a collaborative and supportive culture where I can add value while continuing to learn and grow.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communicator

Being highly educated, emotionally intelligent, and a naturally social creature has helped me develop excellent written and verbal communication skills. I am able to communicate and present confidently, clearly, and expressively.

- While working for North Yorkshire County Council, my ability to communicate effectively was a contributing factor in me being given the responsibility of training fellow staff members in the "Therapeutic Crisis Intervention" model.

#### Intelligent & Quick to Learn

My thirst for knowledge began at a young age and shows no signs of ever being quenched. My genuine love of learning, personal drive, natural curiosity, commitment to work hard, and strong time-management and organisational skills have helped me succeed in both the education and employment arenas.

- Awarded scholarships for undergraduate and post-graduate study and graduated at the top of the class in both.
- Because I am able to easily understand and apply new learning, I have frequently taken on the role of helping other team members grasp and incorporate new information and systems.

#### Team Player

I am open minded, flexible, solution-focused, and always willing to lend a helping hand. These qualities, along with my can-do attitude and the fact that I can be relied upon to fulfil my responsibilities, make me a valuable team member.

- I have years of experience working as part of internal and multi-agency teams and am capable of negotiating and liaising with others to reach mutually beneficial solutions. Furthermore, I have a demonstrated ability to form positive working relationships with colleagues and stakeholders at all levels.

#### Organised & Diligent

I am a highly organised person who enjoys creating and maintaining order and gains satisfaction from completing tasks to a high standard.

- My reputation for producing high-quality reports and possessing a keen eye for detail led to me being selected by senior management to assist with a bid for funding from the Department for Education’s Innovation Programme, which was successful in securing £1.2million for the “No Wrong Door” pilot scheme in North Yorkshire.

#### Adaptable & Adventurous

I'm experienced in flexing my style to appropriately fit a wide variety of situations and interactions (working with teenagers certainly keeps you on your toes). Furthermore, I like a challenge and am always up for trying something new (you know, like changing careers entirely).

- Integral role in successfully implementing the innovative “Safe Steps” pilot programme into live service; Ofsted rated the home Good at first inspection (January 2016).

## Experience

The majority of my previous working experience was dedicated to supporting children and young people. The three places I've worked most recently were all residential homes for Looked After Children (13-18yrs) and, in the spirit of the coding philosophy DRY, I will only summarise my duties and responsibilities for these jobs once below as there was a great deal of crossover.

**Olive House (employed by Hays Recruitment)** (May 2016 to Nov. 2016)   
*Agency Support Worker*

**St Christopher's Fellowship** (July 2015 to March 2016)

**North Yorkshire County Council** (Sept. 2009 to July 2015)   
*"No Wrong Door" Portfolio Lead* (May 2015 to July 2015)  
*Senior Children's Home Worker* (Dec. 2011 to May 2015)
*Children's Home Worker* (Sept. 2009 to Dec. 2011)

•	Delivered, and motivated others to deliver, high quality care to challenging service users with varied and complex needs in a demanding environment.
•	Oversaw the development, implementation and monitoring of individual young people's care plans and worked effectively in partnership with other agencies to safeguard and promote the welfare of young people.
•	Responsible for monitoring performance in line with standards and regulations, and ensuring both that targets were achieved and any gaps in practice or recording quality were quickly identified and addressed.
•	Managed the rota to accommodate the budget and meet the needs of the service.

•	Participated in the recruitment and induction of new staff and held responsibility for the supervision and appraisal of up to six members of the team.

In between (and amidst) being a student and commencing my previous career I held a number of other positions (*Children's Worker*, *Social Care Administrator*, *Drug Court Caseworker*, *Garden Associate*, *Intern Victim Advocate*, and *Recreation/Kitchen Assistant*) and am, of course, happy to discuss my varied experiences and the valuable transferable skills I gained.
